## Description

DTMF.js is a simple Javascript module for generating DTMF (Dual Tone â€“ Multi Frequency)
tones.  This is handy for simulating the sounds that touch-tone phones produce.

## Usage

### Including the DTMF library

Include the DTMF.js library in your HTML:

```html
<script src="js/DTMF.js"></script>
<script src="js/your-custom.js"></script>
```

### Using the DTMF library

Playing tones could not be easier!  Here's an example:

```js
DTFM.playKey('2');  // plays the DTMF tones for the telephone button "2"
```
This will play the appropriate DTMF tone.  You need to stop the tone using
```js
DTFM.stopKey('2');
```

Supported tones are 0-9, #, and *.
