COMMUNITY SUPORTED SCRIPT!

Weyoun, leader of the Vorta, a race that brutally imposed their masters' will across the galaxy

As the name implies, this script applies order by force. Although this script's original intent was to
normalize voicemail transcription settings across all descendants, it's grown to normalize other
settings and also to just run generic functions across all sub-accounts like rebooting all phones in
all sub-accounts.

To install, just download, make a venv, install requirements.txt and run weyoun.py. It's all you need to do, everything else is interactive. Pretty typical python script...

Python 3.7+ required
